### Hi there, it's Ronyâœ¨

I recently started my journey as a developer, but I already knew for sure that this is my passion. I like to realize every day that there are no impossible tasks in development, there is only the right approach to solving them. I discovered that development is a whole world in which you can use its own laws in any way you need.

During my studies, I discovered an amazing ability to independently study even the most difficult concepts for me. And I like to dive deeper and deeper into this area.

My goal is to make any product I come across even better. And I love doing it.

I'd love to be part of your team if this resonates with you!

Thank you :)
